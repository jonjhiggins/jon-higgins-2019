title: Hi, I'm a front-end developer based in Bristol, UK.
---

I work within the web industry as I love learning new skills and helping others improve theirs, experimenting with new technologies, creative collaboration and building great web products.

### Personal

I've recently moved back to the UK following 2.5 great years living and working in Melbourne, Australia.

- Injuries-permitting, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/13456097), cycling and the occasional swim.
- I bloody love [music](http://www.last.fm/user/jhig_uk).
- Also keen on [travelling](https://www.instagram.com/jonjhiggins/), camping and exploring places.
